27,"a2dp-codecs & avinfo: Fix parsing MPEG bit rate values

Redefine bitrate field in a2dp_mpeg_t struct in endian neutral way and
separate vbr field according to A2DP specification. Define new macros
MPEG_GET_BITRATE() and MPEG_SET_BITRATE() for manipulating with bitrate
like for a2dp_aac_t struct.

And fix meaning of bitrate field. According to A2DP specification, it is
bitrate index, not bitrate itself. According to MPEG specification, each
MPEG layer have different bitrates for bitrate indexes. Therefore define
correctly bitrates for Layers 1, 2 and 3.

This fixes problems with parsing bitrate field in a2dp_mpeg_t struct as it
was broken due to endianity and it was broken for Layer 1 and 2 as bitrate
definitions was for Layer 3.

34,"Ensure trivially copyable dtype when masquerading XlaExpressions.

We pass XlaExpressions between kernels by masquerading them as tensors.
This works by encoding the XlaExpression within the allocated tensor_data.
As long as this data is not interpreted as its original dtype, this works
ok. However, if a tensor gets copied and the tensor_data is inspected for
copying, this might fail if the copy logic tries to interpret the
potentially illegal tensor_data.
We already had special code for DT_VARIANT tensors and this change extends
it to all dtypes that are not copyable via memcopy.

The old behavior triggered a bug in the opensource build when passing around
the result of an XLA constant operation with dtype string.

so i've been wondering what is going on for a few days... and i've
figured it out finally... my mouse seems ot like to generate 1000
events per second. not your usual 100 or 200. it only happened on this
one machine so i was wondering what on earth was up. this machine was
different in other ways like an arm cpu, differing gpu (rx550),
different distro and so on. this is creating a storm of motion events..
and this is causing all sorts of overhead in just trying to deal with
them all like generate more internal events, emit signals for every
one of them and so on. there is no attempt to play catch-up or
anything - just build up a bigger and bigger queue of them to deal
with. this is NOT GOOD. this restores our old commented out event
skipper that got commented out during some xcb work actually -
not on its own. it was a huge xcb patch that commented it out.

this restores it and makes it a little cleaner with a bool and now the
perf issues i was seeing are gone. this is such a major performance
fix that this deserves a backport.

Summary:
from https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/realloc
```
On success, returns the pointer to the beginning of newly allocated memory.
To avoid a memory leak, the returned pointer must be deallocated with free()
or realloc(). The original pointer ptr is invalidated and any access to it
is undefined behavior (even if reallocation was in-place).

On failure, returns a null pointer. The original pointer ptr remains valid
and may need to be deallocated with free() or realloc(). ```
So a temporary to test if `realloc` failed
then use the original pointer to use `free`.

https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/37853#discussion_r300974699

The existing code was trading startup perf for throughput in a codepath that is unlikely to be executed commonly. The common scenario is that the `UserPreferencesChanging` event is not fired for the entire lifetime of the app (I left an app listening for this event running for an hour of normal work and never once was the event fired. I then changed system colors to force it).

60,"    Implement lowering of quant.dcast to the fxpmathops and standard dialect.

    Note that I broke this out as a separate pass because intermediate transformations often produce qcast/dcast ops that are integral to the transformation, and it is typical to want to lower any remaining, unmatched casts at the end of quantization. If this flexibility ends up not being needed, they can be collapsed into the same pass. This is included in the same cpp file because all of the math ops will need to defer to emitting quantize/dequantize logic for cases that they cannot be fully lowered to fixed-point math.

    Also, the new convertistof op needs to be evaluated for inclusion in StandardOps.

71,"iris: Handle binding table in the driver

Stop using brw_compiler to lower the final binding table indices for
surface access.  This is done by simply not setting the
'prog_data->binding_table.*_start' fields.  Then make the driver
perform this lowering.

This is a better place to perfom the binding table assignments, since
the driver has more information and will also later consume those
assignments to upload resources.

This also prepares us for two changes: use ibc without having to
implement binding table logic there; and remove unused entries from
the binding table.

Since the `block` field in brw_ubo_range now refers to the final
binding table index, we need to adjust it before using to index
shs->constbuf.

- Use dataflow analysis in buffer assignment.

- Remove the notion of ""Colocated Buffers"" in buffer assignment to
  simplify the code, also remove the tests for them.

- Use dataflow analysis in memory space coloring (dependency of buffer assignment).

This cl brings us one step closer to the promised land without tuple
points to analysis and to the end of the state of split-brain
between dataflow analysis and tuple points to analysis.

It also greatly improves memory of RNN models with heavy use of
control flows and increases performance of some models by prioritizing
buffer reuse of DUS and scatters.

141,"    [TableGen] Add PatternSymbolResolver for resolving symbols bound in patterns

    We can bind symbols to op arguments/results in source pattern and op results in
    result pattern. Previously resolving these symbols is scattered across
    RewriterGen.cpp. This CL aggregated them into a `PatternSymbolResolver` class.

    While we are here, this CL also cleans up tests for patterns to make them more
    focused. Specifically, one-op-one-result.td is superseded by pattern.td;
    pattern-tAttr.td is simplified; pattern-bound-symbol.td is added for the change
    in this CL.

183,"Disallow index types as elements of vector, memref and tensor types

An extensive discussion demonstrated that it is difficult to support `index`
types as elements of compound (vector, memref, tensor) types.  In particular,
their size is unknown until the target-specific lowering takes place.  MLIR may
need to store constants of the fixed-shape compound types (e.g.,
vector<4 x index>) internally and must know the size of the element type and
data layout constraints.  The same information is necessary for target-specific
lowering and translation to reliably support compound types with `index`
elements, but MLIR does not have a dedicated target description mechanism yet.

The uses cases for compound types with `index` elements, should they appear,
can be handled via an `index_cast` operation that converts between `index` and
fixed-size integer types at the SSA value level instead of the type level.

188,"Reimplement prepare_app proper drop checking

Procps-ng does not reliably check for errors. They are for the most part
silently ignored. The only way to approximately check for success is by
checking errno. That's what we've been doing up till now. However, errno
is not mentioned in the contract at all. Syscalls that succeed may zero
errno and mask prior errors.

Pre-3.12 kernels require CAP_SYS_PTRACE for task namespace inspection.
In particular, contemporary TM1 images feature a 3.10 kernel. On such
devices, PROC_FILLNS may result in errno being set to EACCES (unless
overwritten as per the previous paragraph). Such is the case on TM1,
making CheckProperDrop::checkThreads() fail whenever there are two or
more threads.

Checking for identical caps is not enough to ensure proper drop. A rogue
thread may survive sync_threads_internal() (which is racy by nature),
use capset() to set main thread's caps to zero, then terminate before
CheckProperDrop::getThreads() starts due to a lucky interleaving. This
can be guarded against by mandating capabilities to be zeroed for all
threads.

* Replace procps-ng usage with local code.
* Assert zero caps instead of identical caps.
* Refrain from checking pid and user namespaces, kernel guarantees
  consistency across threads (see man unshare(2)).
* Compute the set of checked namespace kinds as a bitmask at manager
  startup, ipc the bitmask to clients in prepare_app return payload.
* Set bitmask to zero for pre-3.12 kernels that require CAP_SYS_PTRACE
  for task namespace inspection.
* Disable compilation of test_check_proper_drop.cpp. The tests were
  written under the assumption that caps do not have to be zeroed. This
  is no longer the case. Zeroing caps requires fork support, there are
  also new edge cases to test. This makes the needed change substantial.
  By review request it will be included in a future commit.

214,"intel/fs: Fix workaround for VxH indirect addressing bug under control flow.

The current workaround for this hardware bug involved marking the ADD
instruction used to initialize the address register as NoMask on
Gen12, which was based on the assumption that the problem was caused
by a hardware bug affecting the application of the execution mask to
the address register write.

However that doesn't seem to be the case: The address register write
was working correctly, the real problem leading to hangs on TGL is
that the indirect addressing logic is unable to deal with garbage
values in the address register (e.g. misaligned offsets), even for
channels which are currently inactive due to non-uniform control flow.
The current workaround isn't able to avoid that situation in general,
since the result of the NoMask ADD instruction for a dead channel is
calculated based on the corresponding (dead) component of the
indirect_byte_offset source, which would still be undefined in the
likely case that the source was initialized under control flow itself.

This would lead to hangs whenever MOV_INDIRECT was used under
non-uniform control flow in some scenarios like a tessellation shader
from GFXBench5/gl_4 (AKA Car Chase) on TGL.  In addition I've managed
to reproduce the same issue on earlier platforms by initializing the
whole address register with garbage before the ADD instruction, so
this seems to be a long-standing issue we have avoided mostly by luck.

This patch fixes the problem and applies the workaround to all
platforms, since even when the hardware is able to deal with garbage
address values without hanging there might be a significant
performance cost from reading random GRF registers due to the useless
extra EU cycles spent fetching registers for dead channels and due to
the potential for unintended serialization with respect to other
random instructions that could be executed in parallel, which may have
had a cost of the order of hundreds of cycles in the worst case
scenario.

This change adds the Native library resolving event, to be raised as the last attempt to resolve a native DLL in an AssemblyLoadContext.

With this change, the DllImport resolution sequence is as follows (stopping at any step with successful resolution):

* If the invoking-assembly is not in the default load context, call AssemblyLoadContext.LoadUnmanagedDll()
* Run the default load logic, try loading from:
    * AppDomain cache
    * NATIVE_DLL_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES
    * Invoking-assembly directory, System32, etc. based on DllImportSearchPaths
* Raise the ResolvingUnmanagedDll event

245,"downloadbuffer: Check for flush after seek

In gst_download_buffer_wait_for_data(), when a seek is made with
perform_seek_to_offset() the `qlock` is released temporarily. Therefore,
the flushing condition can be set during this period and should be
checked.

This was not being checked before, causing occasional deadlocks when
GST_DOWNLOAD_BUFFER_WAIT_ADD_CHECK() was called.

GST_DOWNLOAD_BUFFER_WAIT_ADD_CHECK() assumes that the caller has already
checked that we're not flushing before, since this is done when
acquiring the lock; so if we release it temporarily somewhere, we need
to check for flush again.

Without that check, the function would keep waiting for the condition
variable to be notified before checking for flushing condition again,
and that may very well never happen. This was reproduced when during pad
deactivation when running WebKit in gdb.

275,"anv/allocator: Rework chunk return to the state pool.

This commit tries to rework the code that split and returns chunks back
to the state pool, while still keeping the same logic.

The original code would get a chunk larger than we need and split it
into pool->block_size. Then it would return all but the first one, and
would split that first one into alloc_size chunks. Then it would keep
the first one (for the allocation), and return the others back to the
pool.

The new anv_state_pool_return_chunk() function will take a chunk (with
the alloc_size part removed), and a small_size hint. It then splits that
chunk into pool->block_size'd chunks, and if there's some space still
left, split that into small_size chunks. small_size in this case is the
same size as alloc_size.

The idea is to keep the same logic, but make it in a way we can reuse it
to return other chunks to the pool when we are growing the buffer.

v2:
 - Include Jason's suggestions to the algorithm that returns chunks.
 - Update comments.

v3:
 - Disallow returning 0 blocks (Jason).
 - fix min_size in the loop (Jason).
 - remove temporary variables (Jason)
v4:
 - return_chunk() should never return blocks larger than
 pool->block_size.

302,"Autogenerate (de)serialization for Extended Instruction Sets

A generic mechanism for (de)serialization of extended instruction sets
is added with this CL. To facilitate this, a new class
""SPV_ExtendedInstSetOp"" is added which is a base class for all
operations corresponding to extended instruction sets. The methods to
(de)serialization such ops as well as its dispatch is generated
automatically.

The behavior controlled by autogenSerialization and hasOpcode is also
slightly modified to enable this. They are now decoupled.
1) Setting hasOpcode=1 means the operation has a corresponding
   opcode in SPIR-V binary format, and its dispatch for
   (de)serialization is automatically generated.
2) Setting autogenSerialization=1 generates the function for
   (de)serialization automatically.
So now it is possible to have hasOpcode=0 and autogenSerialization=1
(for example SPV_ExtendedInstSetOp).

Since the dispatch functions is also auto-generated, the input file
needs to contain all operations. To this effect, SPIRVGLSLOps.td is
included into SPIRVOps.td. This makes the previously added
SPIRVGLSLOps.h and SPIRVGLSLOps.cpp unnecessary, and are deleted.

The SPIRVUtilsGen.cpp is also changed to make better use of
formatv,making the code more readable.

312,"intel/fs: Don't touch accumulator destination while applying regioning alignment rule

In some shaders, you can end up with a stride in the source of a
SHADER_OPCODE_MULH.  One way this can happen is if the MULH is acting on
the top bits of a 64-bit value due to 64-bit integer lowering.  In this
case, the compiler will produce something like this:

mul(8)    acc0<1>UD   g5<8,4,2>UD   0x0004UW      { align1 1Q };
mach(8)   g6<1>UD     g5<8,4,2>UD   0x00000004UD  { align1 1Q AccWrEnable };

The new region fixup pass looks at the MUL and sees a strided source and
unstrided destination and determines that the sequence is illegal.  It
then attempts to fix the illegal stride by replacing the destination of
the MUL with a temporary and emitting a MOV into the accumulator:

mul(8)    g9<2>UD     g5<8,4,2>UD   0x0004UW      { align1 1Q };
mov(8)    acc0<1>UD   g9<8,4,2>UD                 { align1 1Q };
mach(8)   g6<1>UD     g5<8,4,2>UD   0x00000004UD  { align1 1Q AccWrEnable };

Unfortunately, this new sequence isn't correct because MOV accesses the
accumulator with a different precision to MUL and, instead of filling
the bottom 32 bits with the source and zeroing the top 32 bits, it
leaves the top 32 (or maybe 31) bits alone and full of garbage.  When
the MACH comes along and tries to complete the multiplication, the
result is correct in the bottom 32 bits (which we throw away) and
garbage in the top 32 bits which are actually returned by MACH.

This commit does two things:  First, it adds an assert to ensure that we
don't try to rewrite accumulator destinations of MUL instructions so we
can avoid this precision issue.  Second, it modifies
required_dst_byte_stride to require a tightly packed stride so that we
fix up the sources instead and the actual code which gets emitted is
this:

mov(8)    g9<1>UD     g5<8,4,2>UD                 { align1 1Q };
mul(8)    acc0<1>UD   g9<8,8,1>UD   0x0004UW      { align1 1Q };
mach(8)   g6<1>UD     g5<8,4,2>UD   0x00000004UD  { align1 1Q AccWrEnable };

Existing builders generated by ODS require attributes to be passed

parameter builders, which is primarily to be used by programmatic
C++ code generation; it is inconvenient for separate-parameter
builders meant to be called in manually written C++ code because
it requires developers to wrap raw values into mlir::Attribute by
themselves.

This CL extends to generate additional builder methods that
take raw values for attributes and handles the wrapping in the
builder implementation. Additionally, if an attribute appears
late in the arguments list and has a default value, the default
value is supplied in the declaration if possible.

342,"[xamlc] new <XFXamlCValidateOnly> MSBuild property for Debug builds (#7407)

XamlC is currently enabled for most Xamarin.Forms projects in `Debug`
and `Release` configurations. It enables faster startup/runtime
performance, XAML-syntax checking at build time--both quiet useful!

However, there is a build-time cost to using XamlC: each assembly is
loaded via Mono.Cecil, IL generated, and saved back to disk as an
additional step after Rosyln has compiled the assembly.

The proposal would be to add a new experimental MSBuild property, that
can be enabled for `Debug` mode such as:

    <PropertyGroup Condition="" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' "">
      <!-- ... -->
      <XFXamlCValidateOnly>True</XFXamlCValidateOnly>
    </PropertyGroup>

This would do the following:

* `OptimizeIL` is skipped.
* Assemblies are analyzed, but no changes written to disk.
* No symbols are loaded via Mono.Cecil, we don't need them if we
  aren't writing back to disk!

This will improve build performance, and we don't lose the build-time
error checking for XAML.

Down the road, we could consider moving the MSBuild property to be the
default for `Debug` builds or change the Xamarin templates. I think it
would be wise to require developers to opt-in to try this out.

~~ Results ~~

I tested this change by building the ControlGallery after changing one
line of XAML:

    msbuild Xamarin.Forms.ControlGallery.Android\Xamarin.Forms.ControlGallery.Android.csproj /clp:performancesummary /p:XFXamlCValidateOnly=True

    Before:
    1979 ms  XamlCTask                                  1 calls
    After:
     923 ms  XamlCTask                                  1 calls

I *only* tested `Debug` builds.

Right, so it's faster. But let's keep the entire developer loop in
mind, how much slower is startup?

    Before:
    09-05 14:37:32.274  1169  1192 I ActivityManager: Displayed AndroidControlGallery.AndroidControlGallery/md546303760447087909496d02dc7b17ae8.Activity1: +3s890ms

After three runs, it seems this app suffers 25-50ms slowdown to
startup, and gains 1 second of build time improvement. A good net-win!

Other apps that have significantly more XAML will have different
results. I suspect the build time improvement will be even better, but
the hit to startup could be worse. With this setting opt-in, we can

393,"nspawn: Allow Capability= to overrule private network setting

The commit:

a3fc6b55ac nspawn: mask out CAP_NET_ADMIN again if settings file turns off private networking

turned off the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability whenever no private networking
feature was enabled. This broke configurations where the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability was explicitly requested in the configuration.

Changing the order of evalution here to allow the Capability= setting
to overrule this implicit setting:

Order of evaluation:

1. if no private network setting is enabled, CAP_NET_ADMIN is removed
2. if a private network setting is enabled, CAP_NET_ADMIN is added
3. the settings of Capability= are added
4. the settings of DropCapability= are removed

This allows the fix for #11755 to be retained and to still allow the
admin to specify CAP_NET_ADMIN as additional capability.

405,"Add a hook to skip checking for GCE credentials.

Currently, when attempting to fetch an object from GCS, TF will attempt to
detect the GCE metadata service, and (if available) use the metadata service
for fetching auth tokens.

However, in many environments (such as Colab), all attempts to reach the
metadata service will fail by timing out. TF will valiantly retry, leading to
a situation where calling `tf.io.gfile.exists('gs://some-public-bucket')` will
take almost 700s (!) to finish all retries. Once these retries complete, we
attempt the request with an empty bearer token, and the request succeeds.

Once the request succeeds, TF sets an indefinite expiration time, meaning that
an interactive user can't (say) call `gcloud auth` and try again.

This change addresses this problem by adding a new hook for completely
skipping the GCE credential fetch, in the form of the `$NO_GCE_CHECK`
environment variable. This already exists in other Google auth libraries, eg
the Java client:
  https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/999de3b11de320354a8ff80a8dc906723d708cf4/oauth2_http/java/com/google/auth/oauth2/DefaultCredentialsProvider.java#L79
When set to any value (even the empty string), the google auth provider
completely skips attempts to talk to the GCE metadata service. In addition, we
don't set an indefinite expiration time in this case, so that future attempts
to fetch credentials aren't skipped.

Fixes #25463. (At least, provides the hook for Colab to use.)
Offers one potential solution to #25464.

473,"touchpad: don't allow for multifinger tapping after a move

In the current implementation, movements > threshold and timeouts usually move
to HOLD state and continue from there. Where a finger is lifted, we go back
up the diagram into the previous finger count's HOLD state.

The side-effect of this is that a tap of a finger can be counted as tap even
after a movement:

- two fingers down, move to scroll, hold down
- third finger down, third finger up

This sequence triggers an erroneous three-finger tap. Once the motion
threshold is hit by any touch, no finger must trigger 2/3 finger tap events
while any touch is down.

The false tap is only triggered where the new finger can execute a tap without
any other finger changing any property. This can be triggered on the
reporter's Dell Precision 5520 but on most other touchpads, a new finger down
will trigger slight movement, pressure or touch size updates and thus the bug
cannot be triggered.

In M63, MaybeCheckCSP() method was used to decide navigation policy
by checking CSP rules. After M63, the method was removed in upstream
patches [1] & [2] which caused the navigation policy to be decided
by ContentRendererClient. For WebApps, it is routed to WRTRenderClient.
In WRT, the navigation policy is decided but also requests app_control
to the refused URL to support backward compatibility which can't be
avoided, thus resulting in unexpected launch of VD Browser.

[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1037804
[2] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1083825

itself, so that the request doesn't reach WRT.

593,"path-util: get rid of prefix_root()

prefix_root() is equivalent to path_join() in almost all ways, hence
let's remove it.

There are subtle differences though: prefix_root() will try shorten
multiple ""/"" before and after the prefix. path_join() doesn't do that.
This means prefix_root() might return a string shorter than both its
inputs combined, while path_join() never does that. I like the
path_join() semantics better, hence I think dropping prefix_root() is
totally OK. In the end the strings generated by both functon should
always be identical in terms of path_equal() if not streq().

This leaves prefix_roota() in place. Ideally we'd have path_joina(), but
I don't think we can reasonably implement that as a macro. or maybe we
can? (if so, sounds like something for a later PR)

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/37098

.NET Core depends on ICU when running on Linux/OSX. Recently some people raised some failure on the framework stack. After investigation we found a regression in ICU which is the root cause of this failure. The regression is, when calling ICU to get some date patterns/properties, in some cases ICU return error code U_MISSING_RESOURCE_ERROR. Although the framework code written to fallback to some invariant values at that time, but we had some wrong line of code which assumed we never fail and trying to access the returned value without checking. That cause the framework to throw NullReferenceException.

The fix here is to make the framework resilient against such cases and continue to run nicely. I have contact ICU support members and I learned there is similar issue tracked in ICU repo https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20558

This was a terrible oversight, but the point of having a small native type for future was
for making them efficient. Still we were using one Eo object for dispatching per future
to dispatch new value. I could have gathered all the dispatch with just one object, but
at the end we do have one object that notify us of the loop iteration... the loop object!
And we have event on that object that we can rely to trigger the dispatching of future
without requiring any additional object. So let's do that instead.

This change extends the recent optimization for caching a constant output tensor from a kernel in the executor, which avoids dispatch overhead for kernels like `ConstOp`, `VarHandleOp`, etc. that always produce the same value. In this case, since the original kernel retains ownership of the tensor for at least as long as the executor is alive, there is no need to increment (and later decrement) the reference count for the underlying `TensorBuffer`, and we can avoid potentially expensive inter-core cache invalidations when those tensors are used concurrently (e.g. in inference).

For a while now the jit has been able to promote an outer struct A with an
inner struct field B that itself has a single non-struct field C, provided
that C occupies all of B and that C and B are pointer-sized.

For example, this comes up when supporting promotion of `Span<T>`, as a span
contains a `ByReference<T>` field that itself contains a pointer-sized field.

This change relaxes the constraints slightly, allowing B and C to be less than
pointer sized, provided C still occupies all of B, and B is suitably aligned
within A.

Doing so allows promotion of the new `Range` type, which contains two `Index`
fields that each wrap an `int`. This improves performance for uses of `Range`

The assign_extra_samplers() adds the needed extra samplers but they need

Otherwise the plane information is simply lost and all nir_tex_instr use the
same sampler.
Here's an example of the bug:

NIR before st_nir_lower_tex_src_plane:
	vec1 32 ssa_8 = load_const (0x00000000 /* 0.000000 */)
	vec4 32 ssa_9 = tex ssa_0 (texture_deref), ssa_0 (sampler_deref), ssa_5 (coord), ssa_8 (plane)
	vec1 32 ssa_10 = load_const (0x00000001 /* 0.000000 */)
	vec4 32 ssa_11 = tex ssa_0 (texture_deref), ssa_0 (sampler_deref), ssa_5 (coord), ssa_10 (plane)

After:

	vec4 32 ssa_9 = tex ssa_0 (texture_deref), ssa_0 (sampler_deref), ssa_5 (coord)
	vec4 32 ssa_11 = tex ssa_0 (texture_deref), ssa_0 (sampler_deref), ssa_5 (coord)

793,"Organize the dot op emitter a bit better; NFC

This CL pays down some technical debt around dot_op_emitter's organization.  It

 - Extracts out a GetDotImplementationStrategy that decides the lowering
   strategy for a dot operation.  Earlier this logic was scattered through the
   lowering code.

 - Removes calls to PotentiallyImplementedAsEigenDot.  This is an implementation
   detail for dot_op_emitter and exposing it like this has aged poorly in the
   face of the various tiled LLVM IR lowerings we now have.  Instead, we expose
   two more specific hooks: DotOperandsAndResultMustHaveRowMajorLayout and
   DotImplementationCanHandleTranspose.

 - Renames xla_enable_experimental_llvm_ir_gemm to
   xla_force_enable_experimental_llvm_ir_gemm since its behavior is that it
   enables the tiled LLVM IR GEMM even when it does not look profitable.

Note: In parallel_task_assignment the call to PotentiallyImplementedAsEigenDot
was redundant since we already check for non-loop fusions and dots.

This fixes #26684, a memory leak that occurred when repeatedly calling create_file_writer() for new graphs in either tf.contrib.summary or TF 2.0's tf.summary.  The implementation for tf.contrib.summary.summary_writer_initializer_op() held strong references to all graphs that had ever created summary writers, even when those graphs were otherwise unreachable.

We address this by reverting the implementation to use graph collections, since while deprecated, the API this is needed for is only exposed in TF 1.x.

829,"intel/compiler: Move all live interval analysis results into fs_live_variables

This moves the following methods that are currently defined in
fs_visitor (even though they are side products of the liveness
analysis computation) and are already implemented in
brw_fs_live_variables.cpp:

> bool virtual_grf_interferes(int a, int b) const;
> int *virtual_grf_start;
> int *virtual_grf_end;

It makes sense for them to be part of the fs_live_variables object,
because they have the same lifetime as other liveness analysis results
and because this will allow some extra validation to happen wherever
they are accessed in order to make sure that we only ever use
up-to-date liveness analysis results.

This shortens the virtual_grf prefix in order to compensate for the
slightly increased lexical overhead from the live_intervals pointer
dereference.

auto ivs = makeBindables(shapeA.size());

996,"Update/clean up btrfs help and man page V2

Hi all,

enclose you can find a patch which improves the help of the btrfs commands,
 updates the INSTALL file  and  the btrfs (command) man page.

Regarding the help of the btrfs command:
- moved the ""subvolume set-default"" command in the ""subvolume"" commands group
- removed a wrong new line
- small tweak on the basis of Andreas suggestion

Regarding the btrfs command man page:
- renaming the command ""device balance"" in ""filesystem balance"" (thanks to
Andreas Phillipp to highlight that)
- adding the entry ""subvolume find-new""
- document the switches of the command ""filesystem defrag""
- document the <devid> facility of the command ""filesystem resize""
- small tweak on the basis of Andreas suggestion

Regarding the INSTALL file, which was very old, I removed the reference of the
old btrfsctl utility and changed the examples using the btrfs command.
I removed the old (and now wrong) statement about the inability to delete a
subvolume/snapshot

Chris, you can pull the patch from the branch ""help_cleanup"" of the following
repository.

http://cassiopea.homelinux.net/git/btrfs-progs-unstable.git

(or you can browse the changes at
http://cassiopea.homelinux.net/git/btrfs-progs-unstable.git/?p=btrfs-
progs-unstable-all.git;a=summary)

The patch is very simple: only updates the man page, the INSTALL file and
 moves/updates some lines in the help of btrfs command. Comments are welcome.

Regards
G.Baroncelli

This reverts commit da44f5ed91a7757baa083364c9b4e765b4f36540.

We will move back ac.service/amd from user session to system.

From the aul maintainer, /usr/bin/amd has to be run as root, reasons:

1. /usr/bin/amd sets app privilege.
2. /usr/bin/amd mounts cgroup subsystem.
3. When handling some command packets, caller's privilege should be checked.

As said in previous commits, we have to move back ac.service from user session
to system. However since ac.service depends on xorg, and xorg is in user
session, we have to use *busy* checking /tmp/.X0-lock before we starts. This
is ugly, but at least a reasonable fix for now.

(If anyone has better solution, please go ahead to fix this.)

Also, both launchpad-preload@.service and ac.service are actually part of
graphical.target, not multi-user.target.

1083,"btrfs-progs: use ftw() unstead of system(""du"")

size_sourcedir() uses shockingly bad code to try and estimate the size
of the files and directories in a subtree.

- Its use of snprintf(), strcat(), and sscanf() with arbitrarily small
  on-stack buffers manages to overflow the stack a few times when given
  long file names.

  $ BIG=$(perl -e 'print ""a"" x 200')
  $ mkdir -p /tmp/$BIG/$BIG/$BIG/$BIG/$BIG
  $ mkfs.btrfs /tmp/img -r /tmp/$BIG/$BIG/$BIG/$BIG/$BIG
  *** stack smashing detected ***: mkfs.btrfs terminated

- It passes raw paths to system() allowing interpreting file names as
  shell control characters.

  $ mkfs.btrfs /tmp/img -r /tmp/spacey\ dir/
  du: cannot access `/tmp/spacey': No such file or directory
  du: cannot access `dir/': No such file or directory

- It redirects du output to ""temp_file"" in the current directory,
  allowing overwriting of files through symlinks.

  $ echo hi > target
  $ ln -s target temp_file
  $ mkfs.btrfs /tmp/img -r /tmp/somedir/
  $ cat target
  3	/tmp/somedir/

This fixes the worst problems while maintaining -r functionality by
tearing out the system() code and using ftw() to walk the source tree
and sum up st.st_size.

 - Currently using std::vector internally as Dali::Vector cannot support non-trivial types
 - Updated Path Constraints to use new constraints
 - Replace boost::function usage in Constraints
 - Remove weight property from constraints
 - Constraint is no longer an Object, it is a base-object

1345,"loader: Move CreateDevice to device table

Discovered an issue where a layer was doing cleanup
in it's DestroyDevice function but the CreateDevice
was never called.
This happened because the extension was only enabled
on the device chain and the device chain doesn't actually
call CreateDevice. That happens on the Instance chain.
Making it so that we can call down the device chain -
which is terminated by the ICD.
We need to know the real device object to construct the
device chain heiarchy and when calling down the device
chain it should end with the ICD doing the actual device
object creation.

This patch fixes the issue by using the
same process as CreateInstance. The loader will call
the ICD's CreateDevice and pass that in the *pDevice
argument. The layers then ignore the PhysicalDevice parameter
and use the *pDevice to access the device chain.
To prevent the ICD from being called twice needed to
stub in a special loader_GetDeviceChainProcAddr to provide
a stub for only CreateDevice as the end of the chain.

1792,"device: Fix loading devices without Service Changed CCC

This patch provides fix for loading devices which were saved before
support for storing Service Changed CCC was added (a0b886e26).

Without this fix, after daemon is upgraded from pre-a0b886e26 to
current version we do not indicate Service Changed to any previously
bonded device since ""loaded"" CCC value is 0. This means that even if
locla GATT database is changed, bonded peer can assume it did not
change and continue to access structure which yields unexpected
results and this is exactly what happens on iOS devices.

With this patch, if ""ServiceChanged"" group (added by mentioned commit)
does not exist in config file of a bonded device, we assume indications
for Service Changed characteristic value were enabled by peer as per
Core 5.0, Vol 3, Part G, 7.1:

  ""This Characteristic Value shall be configured to be indicated,
   using the Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor by a
   client""

1953,"Add new arguments for installation requests

Added arguments are:
* pkg_type (none, wrt, core, metadata)
* pkg_privilege_level (none, public, platform, partner)

This change is adjusting usage of privilege-checker functions
to its API changes.

Before this patch, privilege-checker used pkgmgr to check these data
about newly installed app. Because security-manager calls
privilege-checker at app install time, this required the pkgmgr db to be
filled before calling security-manager in app installer.
However, installer is currently changing its order of operation
and we can't rely on its data being available at this time.

Since this data is known explicitly by installer, its easy to add this
information to the installation request (per pkg).

If not set (""none"" values), privilege-checker consults pkgmgr
like it used to.

Adding this API will also ease the situation in security-tests, where
pkgmgr DB had to be filled manually before each *fake* app installation
done only for purpose of security-manager API tests.
Now, the installation request in security-tests can be filled with
other-than-none values for both variables, which will result
in pkgmgr DB not being checked at app install time.
